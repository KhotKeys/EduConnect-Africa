## Overview

This is your final, comprehensive project where you will build, secure, and deploy a complete end-to-end DevOps pipeline. You will integrate your work from **Formative 1** (Project Planning) and **Formative 2** (Containerization & CI) to demonstrate a fully automated **"Git-to-Production"** workflow.

**What this means:** A code change merged to the `main` branch should automatically and safely deploy to your live cloud environment without any manual intervention.

### What "Working" Looks Like
By the end, you should be able to:
1. Run `terraform apply` and see all infrastructure created in your cloud account
2. Make a code change, create a PR, and see CI run security scans automatically
3. Merge the PR and watch CD automatically deploy to production
4. Visit your public URL and see the change live within 2-3 minutes
5. Run `terraform destroy` and cleanly remove all resources

**You must test this complete flow at least twice before submitting.**

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will demonstrate your ability to:
- Design and provision cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Implement secure network architecture with public and private subnets
- Automate server configuration using Configuration Management (Ansible)
- Integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipelines (DevSecOps)
- Build fully automated deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Document and present complex technical systems clearly

---

## Infrastructure Components Explained

Your cloud infrastructure will include six key components:

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **VPC/VNet** | Isolated network for your resources | Your private cloud network |
| **Private Subnet VM** | Hosts your application, not directly internet-accessible | Application server (t2.micro/B1s) |
| **Bastion Host** | Secure gateway for SSH access to private resources | Jump server in public subnet |
| **Managed Database** | Persistent data storage with automatic backups | RDS PostgreSQL, Azure MySQL |
| **Security Groups/NSGs** | Firewall rules controlling inbound/outbound traffic | Allow port 80/443, SSH from bastion only |
| **Private Registry** | Secure storage for your Docker images | AWS ECR or Azure ACR |

**Security Note:** Your application VM should NEVER be directly accessible from the internet. All SSH access must go through the Bastion Host.

---

## Core Requirements

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Tool:** Terraform  
**Location:** `terraform/` directory in your repository

**Required Resources:**
- Private network (AWS VPC or Azure VNet)
- Public subnet (for Bastion Host)
- Private subnet (for Application VM and Database)
- Bastion Host/Jumpbox (t2.micro/B1s in public subnet)
- Application VM (t2.micro/B1s in private subnet)
- Managed database (RDS/Azure Database)
- Security Groups/NSGs with proper rules:
  - Allow HTTP/HTTPS from internet to Application VM
  - Allow SSH from Bastion to Application VM only
  - Allow database connections from Application VM only
  - Allow SSH to Bastion from your IP (or anywhere temporarily)
- Private container registry (AWS ECR or Azure ACR)

**Code Structure Requirements:**
```
terraform/
├── main.tf           # Main configuration
├── variables.tf      # Input variables
├── outputs.tf        # Output values (VM IPs, registry URL)
├── terraform.tfvars  # Variable values (git-ignored if contains secrets)
└── README.md         # Terraform-specific documentation
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use variables for all configurable values (region, VM size, etc.)
- Use meaningful resource names (e.g., `devops-app-vm`, not `vm1`)
- Add comments explaining non-obvious configurations
- Use `terraform fmt` to format your code
- Output important values (Bastion IP, App VM private IP, Registry URL)

---

### 2. Configuration Management (Ansible)

**Tool:** Ansible  
**Location:** `ansible/` directory in your repository

**Required Playbook Tasks:**
Your playbook must configure the Application VM to:
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Install required system packages (git, curl, etc.)
3. **Authenticate to your private container registry** (ECR/ACR)
4. **Pull the latest Docker image** from your registry
5. **Deploy/restart the application** using `docker-compose up -d`

**Playbook Structure:**
```yaml
# ansible/deploy.yml
---
- name: Deploy Application to Production
  hosts: app_server
  become: yes
  
  tasks:
    - name: Install Docker
      # your tasks here
    
    - name: Login to private registry
      # your tasks here
    
    - name: Pull latest image
      # your tasks here
    
    - name: Deploy with docker-compose
      # your tasks here
```

**Important Configuration:**
- Your Ansible inventory must use the Bastion Host as a jump/proxy host
- Use `ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q ubuntu@<bastion-ip>"'`
- Test your playbook multiple times before integrating into CD pipeline

**Example Inventory:**
```ini
# ansible/inventory.ini
[app_server]
app-vm ansible_host=<private-ip>

[app_server:vars]
ansible_user=ubuntu
ansible_ssh_common_args='-o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q ubuntu@<bastion-ip>"'
```

---

### 3. DevSecOps Integration

**Goal:** Shift security left by scanning early in the development process.

**Required Security Scans in CI Pipeline:**

#### A. Container Image Scanning
- **Tool Options:** Trivy (recommended), Snyk, or Anchore
- **What to scan:** Your built Docker image
- **Action:** Fail the build if HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities found

**Example (Trivy):**
```yaml
- name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: 'your-image:latest'
    format: 'sarif'
    severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
    exit-code: '1'  # Fail the build
```

#### B. Infrastructure as Code Scanning
- **Tool Options:** tfsec (recommended), Checkov, or Terrascan
- **What to scan:** Your Terraform files in `terraform/` directory
- **Action:** Fail the build if security issues detected

**Example (tfsec):**
```yaml
- name: Run tfsec security scanner
  uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-action@v1.0.0
  with:
    working_directory: terraform/
    soft_fail: false  # Fail the build on issues
```

**Integration Requirements:**
- Both scans must run automatically on every Pull Request
- CI pipeline must be configured as a required status check
- PRs cannot be merged if security scans fail
- Failed scans should show clear error messages in the GitHub Actions log

---

### 4. Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline

**Tool:** GitHub Actions  
**Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/cd.yml`  
**Trigger:** Only on merge to `main` branch (NOT on PRs)

**Required Steps:**
```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      # 1. Run all CI checks
      - Checkout code
      - Run linting
      - Run tests
      - Run security scans
      
      # 2. Build and push to private registry
      - Build Docker image
      - Authenticate to ECR/ACR
      - Tag image with git SHA
      - Push to private registry
      
      # 3. Deploy via Ansible
      - Install Ansible
      - Configure SSH keys
      - Run Ansible playbook against Application VM
```

**Critical CD Requirements:**
- Must push to your private ECR/ACR (NOT Docker Hub)
- Must use GitHub Secrets for credentials (never hardcode)
- Must tag images with commit SHA for traceability
- Must run Ansible playbook to deploy (not manual SSH)
- Must include notification on success/failure (optional but recommended)

**Secrets to Configure:**
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` (for Ansible to access VMs)
- Database credentials (if needed by your app)

---

## Pipeline Architecture

### CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
**Triggers:** On Pull Requests to `main`  
**Purpose:** Quality gates before code can be merged

```
Pull Request Created
        ↓
    Checkout Code
        ↓
    Run Linter
        ↓
    Run Tests
        ↓
    Build Docker Image
        ↓
    Scan Image (Trivy)
        ↓
    Scan IaC (tfsec)
        ↓
    All Pass → Allow Merge
    Any Fail → Block Merge
```

### CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`)
**Triggers:** On merge to `main` only  
**Purpose:** Automated deployment to production

```
Merge to Main
      ↓
  Run CI Checks
      ↓
  Build Image
      ↓
  Push to ECR/ACR
      ↓
  Run Ansible Playbook
      ↓
  Application Updated
      ↓
  Live on Public URL
```

**Important:** CD should NEVER run on PRs, only on successful merges to `main`.

---

## Technical Specifications

### Cloud Provider
- **Options:** AWS or Azure (choose one, be consistent throughout)
- **Region:** Choose one close to East Africa (e.g., `eu-west-1`, `southafricanorth`)

### Compute Resources
- **Bastion Host:** t2.micro (AWS) or B1s (Azure)
- **Application VM:** t2.micro (AWS) or B1s (Azure)
- **Database:** db.t3.micro RDS (AWS) or B-series Azure Database

### Container Registry
- **AWS:** Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- **Azure:** Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- **Not Allowed:** Docker Hub (for final deployment)

### Application Requirements
- Must be containerized (built in Formative 2)
- Must connect to the managed database
- Must be accessible via HTTP/HTTPS
- Must demonstrate a visible change in your video demo

### Version Control
- **Single repository** containing all code
- Proper `.gitignore` (no secrets, no `terraform.tfstate`)
- Meaningful commit messages
- Branch protection rules enabled on `main`

---

## AI & Academic Integrity

### ALLOWED: AI Assistance for Application Code
You may use AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude) to help write:
- Your application logic (Python, Node.js, Go, etc.)
- Database queries and models
- Frontend components and styling
- Unit tests for your application

### NOT ALLOWED: AI-Generated DevOps Configuration

**You must write the following files yourself:**
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)
- Terraform files (`terraform/*.tf`)
- Ansible playbooks (`ansible/*.yml`)

**Why this policy?**  
The purpose of this course is to learn DevOps skills. Using AI to generate configuration files prevents you from understanding these critical concepts. Submitting AI-generated DevOps config constitutes **academic misconduct** and will result in a zero for the project.

**How we verify:**
We will review your git history, ask questions about your configuration choices, and may conduct verbal assessments of your understanding.

**If you're stuck:**
- Review course materials and recorded lectures
- Attend office hours
- Post questions in the class discussion forum (without sharing complete solutions)
- Collaborate with your team members

✅ Use GitHub Secrets and environment variables

❌ Making database publicly accessible  
✅ Keep database in private subnet, only accessible from app VM

❌ SSH keys committed to repository  
✅ Add to .gitignore, use GitHub Secrets

❌ Overly permissive security groups (0.0.0.0/0 for all ports)  
✅ Restrict to only necessary ports and sources

### Pipeline Issues
❌ Running CD pipeline on every PR  
✅ CD should only trigger on merge to `main`

❌ Using Docker Hub instead of private registry  
✅ Must use ECR (AWS) or ACR (Azure)

# Summative Project: The Complete DevOps Pipeline

Overview
--------
This is the final, comprehensive project where you will build, secure, and deploy your application. You will combine all the work from Formative 1 (Project Planning) and Formative 2 (Containerization & CI) to build the complete end-to-end pipeline, from Infrastructure as Code to a live, automated deployment on a Virtual Machine.

Your goal is to demonstrate a "Git-to-Production" workflow, where a code change merged to the `main` branch is automatically and safely deployed to your live cloud environment.

Core Requirements
-----------------
Your final project must integrate all the following components into a fully automated system, building on your existing repository:

1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

   - Using Terraform, write configuration files to provision a suitable cloud environment for your application. This must include:
     - A private network (VPC/VNet).
     - A Virtual Machine (AWS EC2 or Azure VM) in a private subnet.
     - A Bastion Host/Jumpbox (a small VM in a public subnet) to allow Ansible/SSH access.
     - A managed database (RDS/Azure DB).
     - All necessary Security Groups / Network Security Groups (e.g., allow public web traffic, allow SSH from bastion).
     - A private container registry (AWS ECR or Azure ACR).

   - Your Terraform code must be modular (e.g., `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `modules/`) and stored in a `terraform/` directory.

2. Configuration Management (Ansible)

   - Create an Ansible Playbook (stored in `ansible/`).
   - The playbook must configure the VM to run your app, including:
     - Installing Docker and Docker Compose.
     - Installing any other required packages and system configuration.

3. DevSecOps Integration

   - Enhance your GitHub Actions CI pipeline (from Formative 2) to include security scanning that runs early in the pipeline:
     - Container Image Scanning (e.g., Trivy, Snyk).
     - Infrastructure as Code Scanning (e.g., tfsec, checkov).
   - The pipeline must be configured to fail the build if critical vulnerabilities are detected.

4. Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline

   - Create a GitHub Actions workflow (for example `cd.yml`) that triggers only on a merge to `main`.
   - The Deploy-to-Production pipeline must automate:
     - Running all CI checks (lint, test, security scans).
     - Building the Docker image and pushing it to the private container registry provisioned by Terraform.
     - Authenticating to your cloud provider and registry.
     - Running the Ansible Playbook against the VM to deploy the new image (e.g., login to registry, pull image, restart service via `docker-compose up -d`).

5. Final Presentation & Evidence

   - A Live, Working Application: The service must be accessible via a public URL (through a Load Balancer or accessible IP).
   - Full Automation Demo: Record a 10–15 minute video demonstrating Git-to-Production flow: code change → PR → CI/security checks → merge → CD deploy → change live.
   - Final `README.md`: The README must serve as the operations manual and include an architecture diagram, live app link, and setup instructions.

Academic / AI Policy Reminder
---------------------------
You are encouraged to use AI tools to help write application code (e.g., Python, Node.js). However, for this course you MUST author the following DevOps configuration files yourself (do not submit AI-generated versions):

- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- GitHub Actions workflow files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)
- Terraform files (`terraform/*.tf`)
- Ansible playbooks (`ansible/*.yml`)

These artifacts exist to teach you infrastructure and automation skills. Submitting AI-generated config files is considered academic misconduct for this assessment.

Success Checklist
-----------------

- [ ] Your `terraform/` directory contains all your `.tf` files.
- [ ] Your `ansible/` directory contains your playbook.
- [ ] Your CI pipeline (on PRs) runs linting, tests, and security scans.
- [ ] Your CI pipeline scans both your Docker image and Terraform code.
- [ ] Your CI pipeline is required to pass before merging to `main`.
- [ ] Your CD pipeline (on `main`) pushes your image to your private ECR or ACR.
- [ ] Your CD pipeline runs your Ansible playbook as the final deployment step.
- [ ] Your `README.md` is updated with the live URL and an architecture diagram.
- [ ] Your video demo shows the entire process: git push, PR, merge, pipeline run, and the change appearing live.

Deliverables
------------

- GitHub repository URL (single repo, well organized).
- Live application URL.
- Final presentation video link.

Helpful Hints
------------

- Keep secrets out of the repository — use GitHub Secrets for credentials and tokens used by Actions.
- Use Terraform state remote backend (e.g., S3 with locking) for team work.
- Make small, incremental PRs and demonstrate the pipeline running early.

Good luck — build, secure, and automate your app all the way to production!
