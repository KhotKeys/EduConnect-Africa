## 🐳 Docker & CI (Formative 2)

This project has been extended to include containerization and a CI pipeline for Formative 2.

Quick start with Docker Compose:

```powershell
# Build and start the app
docker-compose up --build

# Open http://localhost or http://localhost:80
```

Run locally without Docker (Node.js):

```powershell
npm ci
npm run start
```

CI details:
- A GitHub Actions workflow is configured at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- The workflow triggers on pushes to branches other than `main` and on pull requests targeting `main`.
- It installs dependencies, runs `npm run lint` (ESLint), runs `npm test` (Jest), and attempts to build the Docker image.

Notes / next steps for submission evidence:
- Enable branch protection rules on `main` and require the CI checks to pass before merging (needs to be configured in the GitHub repo settings).
- Create a feature branch, open a pull request to `main`, and verify CI runs (you should have at least one failing and then fixed run as required by the assignment).
CI details:
- A GitHub Actions workflow is configured at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- The workflow runs lint, tests, builds a Docker image, pushes it to Amazon ECR (if configured), and can deploy to an EC2 host via SSH.

CI / Deployment secrets (required)
Before you can run the full pipeline and deploy to EC2, add these repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` — AWS key ID with ECR permissions
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` — AWS secret key
- `AWS_REGION` — AWS region (for example: eu-north-1)
- `ECR_REPO` — full ECR repository URI (example: 012345678901.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/edulearn/web)
- `EC2_HOST` — public DNS or IP of your EC2 instance
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_EC2` — PEM private key to SSH into EC2 (keep private)

Notes about the current deploy flow
- The workflow builds the Docker image and pushes it to the `ECR_REPO` tag `:latest`.
- Deploy runs an SSH action that will:
   - install Docker on the remote host (Ubuntu/Debian flow) if missing,
   - install the AWS CLI if missing,
   - use the provided AWS creds to log into ECR on the remote host, then run `docker compose pull` and `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`.

Security & best practices
- For production, prefer attaching an IAM role to the EC2 instance with ECR pull permissions instead of exporting AWS credentials to the host.
- Keep secrets in GitHub Actions secrets only (do NOT commit keys or tokens to the repo).

Triggering the pipeline
- Push to the `main` branch or open a PR to `main` to trigger the CI workflow.
- You can re-run jobs from the Actions UI or force a run by pushing an empty commit:

```powershell
git commit --allow-empty -m "ci: rerun workflow after deploy fixes"
git push origin main
```

If deploy fails with auth errors when pulling from ECR, verify that `ECR_REPO` and the `AWS_*` secrets are correct and that the IAM user has ECR permissions (e.g., `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`, `ecr:BatchGetImage`, `ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability`).

If your EC2 instance runs a non-Ubuntu OS (Amazon Linux, CentOS, etc.), the remote install commands will need to be adjusted — tell me the distro and I'll update the workflow accordingly.
